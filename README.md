# Clock and ToDo List
In this project we have made clock and todo list with the help of bootstrap framework and javascript.  Clock gives time with day and date and todo list is used to add title with description in the local storage , it also have some other functionality like delete which is used to delete the list item one by one and clear list gives a confirm message to delete all the contents from the localstorage if we press yes then it will clear all the contents otherwise not.

#### Clock:
* The clock displays the current time in hours, minutes and seconds in a 12-hour format.
* It also displays the current day of the week and the date in the format of "Day, Month date, Year".
* The clock updates itself in real time without requiring the user to refresh the page.
#### Todo List:
* The todo list allows the user to add items to the list by entering a title and description.
* The added items are stored in the local storage of the user's browser so that they persist even after the page is closed or refreshed.
* Each added item is displayed as a separate list item with a checkbox and a delete button.
* The user can check the checkbox to mark an item as completed, and uncheck it to mark it as incomplete.
* The user can delete an item by clicking the delete button, which removes the item from the list and also deletes it from the local storage.
* The "Clear List" button clears all the items from the list and asks the user for confirmation before doing so.
#### General:
* The project uses the Bootstrap framework to create a responsive layout and style the clock and todo list.
* The project uses JavaScript to add interactivity to the clock and todo list, and to store and retrieve data from the local storage.
* The project provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for the user to manage their daily tasks and keep track of time.
